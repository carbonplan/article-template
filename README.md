This repository contains a template for developing an article to be included on our research site at [carbonplan.org/research](https://carbonplan.org/research).

This is basically a mini [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app that wraps your article content with our layout for development purposes.

To start working on a new article click the [Use this template](https://github.com/carbonplan/article-template/generate) button, or clone this repo. You'll want to do all writing and development in the top-level `article` folder, which should include an `index.md` file for primary markdown content and a `components` folder for custom React components that you can import inside `index.md`. You should also update `contents.js` with the metadata for your article, like `authors` and `tags`. You shouldn't need to touch anything else.

When an article is finished, we publish it by copying the contents of the `article` folder into a folder named with the article `id` in the `articles` folder in our the main [research](https://github.org/carbonplan/research) site. We also update the index listing. That's it!

## to build the site locally

Assuming you already have `Node.js` installed, you can install the build dependencies as:

```shell
npm install .
```

To start a development version of the site, simply run:

```shell
npm run dev
```

and then visit `http://localhost:5001` in your browser.
