# (carbon)plan / article template

This repository contains a template for developing an article to be included on our research site at [carbonplan.org/research](https://carbonplan.org/research).

This is basically a mini [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app that, when finished, can be included as a standalone article. We simply take the contents of `pages` and add it to a folder with the same name.

## to build the site locally

Assuming you already have `Node.js` installed, you can install the build dependencies as:

```shell
npm install .
```

To start a development version of the site, simply run:

```shell
npm run dev
```

and then visit `http://localhost:6000` in your browser.
